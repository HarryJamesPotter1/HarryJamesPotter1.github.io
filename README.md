We created a Captcha (Used to ensure a user is human) for bots, We have three tests that aim to verify that the user is a bot. The tests are nearly impossible for a human to complete! If all three games are completed, we can conclude that the user is a bot! Would you agree that our project is pretty stupid? You can pass every test by pasting a js script in the console of your browser this will emulate what a bot would do to pass the test. 
Look at auto_script.txt for the script.

How to use the script:
1. Open the web page or test you want to work on in your browser.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select Inspect (or Inspect Element) from the context menu.
3. A developer tools panel will open on the right side of your screen. Look for the Console tab in this panel and click on it.
4. Once you're in the console, paste the script into the terminal field and press Enter.
